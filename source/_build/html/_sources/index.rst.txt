SIMBA (Serpent Interface for Multi-physics Based Applications)is a python-based package that aims to facilitate the creation of organized, large-scale, detailed input files for use in the SERPENT monte carlo code. It can also be used to facilitate workflows for multi-physics based applications. The package enables a user-friendly interface, with detailed error checking and documentation. The package is currently hosted on a private repository but will be made available open source to the public to be used by the serpent community soon.
