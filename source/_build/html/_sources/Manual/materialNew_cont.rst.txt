Material
----------

Class representing a material with attributes and function to process each material
object. Material attributes such as density and nuclide, and nuclide fractions 
follow same convention as serpent i.e +,- for density unit type and nuclide naming
follows Z*1000 + A, nuclide fraction type i.e weight fraction, atomic fraction follow
serpent convention aswell. 

density: + (atomic density), - (mass density)
nuclide fractions: + (atomic fractions/densities), -(mass fractions/densities)

	
Basic data definition for a material object.

This class is responsible to store (using ``set``) and retrieve (using
``get``) data for a material.

Attributes
----------
id : str
	material id/name
isBurn : bool
	True/False is material burnable
isModer : bool
	True/False is material a moderator
dens : float
	density: + (atomic density), - (mass density)
nuclides : ndarray
	nuclide naming follows Z*1000 + A
fractions : ndarray
	nuclide fractions: +(atomic fractions/densities), -(mass fractions/densities)
temp : float
	optional set tmp parameter, temp (K)
rgb: str
	optional material color rbg string for plotting
xsLib : str
	material xs library suffix, i.e. "09c"
modLib : str
	if material is of moderating type the thermal scattering data library is
	specified i.e. "ltwr 1001" for H-1
